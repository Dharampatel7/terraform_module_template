## Step-by-Step Guide to Configure Azure Authentication

Create a Service Principal: First, you'll need to create a service principal in Azure. You can do this using the Azure CLI.

``` 
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name terraform-sp --role Contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
```
Replace {subscription-id} with your actual Azure subscription ID. This command will return a JSON object with your appId, password, tenant, and more.

Set Environment Variables: To make these credentials available to Terraform, set the following environment variables using the values returned by the previous command:

```
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=<appId>
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=<password>
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscription-id>
export ARM_TENANT_ID=<tenant> 
```

Test Your Configuration
After setting up your environment variables, you can test your configuration by running:

`terraform init` 
`terraform plan`
`terraform apply`

This will authenticate Terraform to your Azure account using the service principal you created, allowing you to manage Azure resources securely.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Unit Tests with Terratest

**Install Terratest:** Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can install it from here. Then, set up your Go environment and install Terratest.

**Create Your Module Directory Structure:** Ensure you have a separate directory for your Terraform module and test files.

```
my-terraform-module/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
└── test/
    ├── test_terraform_module_test.go
    ├── go.mod
    └── go.sum
```

**Initialize a Go Module:** Navigate to the test directory and initialize a new Go module.

````go
cd my-terraform-module/test 
go mod init github.com/<your-username>/terraform-module-test
````
**Install Terratest and Dependencies:** Install Terratest and any other necessary Go modules.

```
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
```

**Create a test file:** Create a new file called test_terraform_module.go in your test directory.

**Run the test:** Execute the test using the go test command.

`go test -v`
